#  AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance and RAG Troubleshooting

## Overview
This project combines advanced AI techniques for anomaly detection, fault classification, and predictive maintenance with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for real-time equipment troubleshooting. Designed for industrial packaging machines, the system empowers proactive maintenance aligned with Industry 4.0 standards.


## Dataset Description
The dataset, titled **Alarm Logs of Industrial Packaging Machines** (https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/alarm-logs-packaging-industry-alpi), includes:
- **Raw Data**: A CSV file (`alarms.csv`) containing timestamped alarm codes and machine serial numbers from 20 machines worldwide (Feb 21, 2019 â€“ Jun 17, 2020).
- **Processed Data**: Preprocessed formats (JSON, Pickle, NPZ) that provide training and testing sequences for tasks such as anomaly detection, next alarm forecasting, and fault classification.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives
- **Anomaly Detection:** Spot deviations in alarm behavior
- **Time-Series Forecasting:** Predict future alarms/events
- **Fault Classification:** Categorize equipment issues using ML
- **RAG Chatbot:** Guide technicians with image- and text-based instructions from manuals
- **LLM Integration:** Leverage language models for real-time fault detection and resolution

## Milestones & GitHub Issues
The project is organized into four key milestones:

1. **Data Preprocessing and Model Training**
   - Data ingestion, cleaning, and feature extraction.
   - Building baseline anomaly detection, forecasting, and fault classification models.

2. **Utilizing LLMs for Fault Identification and System Optimization**
   - Integrating language models for advanced fault identification.
   - Developing real-time monitoring and continuous improvement modules.

3. **Building a RAG-Based Chatbot for Troubleshooting**
   - Designing and implementing a chatbot to assist with system diagnostics.
   - Integrating data retrieval from historical logs and real-time information.

4. **Model Improvement and Evaluation**
   - Generating synthetic data for model augmentation.
   - Setting up comprehensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning pipelines.
   - Conducting robustness testing and further system refinements.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nurath/Capstone.git
   cd Capstone
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- **Data Processing**:  
  Use `dataset.py` to convert raw alarm logs into processed formats.
  ```bash
  python dataset.py --input raw/alarms.csv --output processed/
  ```
- **Model Training**:  
  Navigate to the `models/` directory and run the training scripts for anomaly detection, forecasting, or fault classification.
  ```bash
  python models/train_anomaly.py
  ```
- **RAG CHATBOT DEPLOYMENT**:
  
  ***Local Deployment***
  - Uses local FAISS, openAI Enbedding, Deepseek or OpenAI, and Manual PDF.
  - Images and chunks stored in local files.
 
  ```bash
  cd RAG_PDF/
  streamlit run app.py
  ```

  ***Cloud Deployment***
  - Uses MongoDB for Text chunks and embeddings and AWS S3 for images.
 
    ```bash
    cd RAG_PDF_1/
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
Make sure .env is configured with OpenAIor DeepSeek, MongoDB URI and AWS keys.
